The API works over the HTTP 1.1 protocol. It exposes a set of resources, which can be used to retrieve and/or modify 
application state. States of resources are represented in JSON. Operations are specified by HTTP request methods, their 
parameters – by URI query string. Response codes are (subset of) those defined by the HTTP standard. The API is stateless.

The application consists of three major parts: **_core_**, **_engine_** and **_data service_**. 
Each part exposes its own resources.

The **_core_** is always running and performs general maintenance functions.

The **_engine_** is the main functional component. It retrieves data from input device, performs tracking and 
classification of faces and bodies, and provides data for data service to collect. It can be started and stopped via 
state resource.

The **_data service_** is responsible for collecting recognition data to and retrieving it from DB. It can be considered 
part of **_engine_**, but is able to run separately. When data service runs as part of engine, it works in 
**_active mode_** (collects data) and has a **_current session_**. If it runs separately, it is in **_passive mode_**
and have no current session (can only retrieve data from previous sessions).

# Authentication

Requests from localhost or with GET method do not require authentication. 
All other requests require authentication using Basic scheme, as described in RFC 2617. 
The authentication parameter realm has value Look.

When  NetworkInterface object is retrieved from server, the following rules apply.

 - Field wpa_passphrase is absent. - Not true currently and questionable generally.
 - If configuration method is DHCP, high-level parameters (except config_method) specify values assigned by DHCP. 
   A parameter can be absent if its value currently cannot be determined (probably because interface is down).

# Group Input Devices


Resources is this group allow to configure input devices.

Input devices are distinguished by type. Look supports cameras and natural interaction (NI) devices (Kinect / Xtion).

A device can be connected to the system locally (via USB for example) or be available via network. They are called 
**local device** and **network device** respectively. Local devices are read-only in API; the client can only select 
one of them as active. Network devices can be added, updated and deleted by the client.
Currently only cameras can be network devices.

More than one device of same type can be available. For example, one could have second camera that is differently placed, 
or used for something beside Look. Each device has the **location**.

To distinguish similar local devices user needs to establish an (informal) agreement about which device is plugged to 
which port. For example, always plug “top” camera to left USB port on motherboard's back, and “bottom” camera to 
right USB port. Then in API a **system location** (data identifying a port) of a device can be used as a reflection of 
its physical placement / purpose / other distinctive property. For local devices the location is its system location.

For network devices the location is an URL.

The active input device is identified by both its type and location. If a device of configured type is not found at 
configured location, the engine will not start.

**Note**: currently only one connected (local) NI device is supported. Its location is empty.

If local device configured as active is unplugged, it still is included in device list, with field plugged set to false. After activation of other (plugged) device, unplugged device is discarded.

Any action changing active input device location (including device switching) is not allowed while engine is running (application is in live mode). The response status in such case is 409 Conflict with corresponding text message. The client must stop the engine, perform configuration changes and start the engine again.

Resources in this group use following data types.
Data type DeviceId represents input device ID. It is an unsigned integer number.

Data type Device represents an input device. It is an object with the following structure

    Device:
        {
            id:

# Group Config

This resource allows to get and set configuration.

Configuration settings logically fall into two categories: **communication settings** and **engine settings**. 
The **communication settings** include domain, password etc. The **engine settings** apply to main application functionality.

    JSON data
    {
        "modules": [ module-list ]
        "system": {
            "web": [ parameter-list ],
            "authorization": [ parameter-list ]
        }
    }

The _module-list_ contains the list of application modules with their parameters.

    module:
        {
            "name": {
                "description": "description",
                "parameters": [ parameter-list ]
            }
        }

where

<table>
    <th bgcolor="#999999">Field</th>
    <th bgcolor="#999999">Type</th>
    <th bgcolor="#999999">Description</th>
    <tr> <td>name</td> <td>String</td> <td>Module name.</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>description</td> <td>String</td> <td>Module description.</td> </tr>
</table>

Each _parameter_ in parameter-list has the following structure:

    parameter:
        {
            "name": "name",
            "display_name": "display_name",
            "description": "description",
            "type": "type",
            "requires_restart": requires_restart,
            "value": value
        }
        
where

                <tr> <td>int</td> <td>Integer number.</td> </tr>
                <tr> <td>real</td> <td>Real number.</td> </tr>

                <tr> <td>ipv4</td> <td>IPv4 address (dotted quad).</td> </tr>
                <tr> <td>map</td> <td>Map. The value of this type is an object. Only object values can be changed. Keys cannot be removed or inserted.</td> </tr>
            </table>
         </td> 
    </tr>
    
    <tr> <td>requires_restart</td> <td>Boolean</td> 
         <td>Specifies if changing value of this parameter requires engine restart.
             This field can be absent in parameters that do not belong to modules (e.g. network configuration parameters).
         </td> 
    </tr>
    <tr> <td>value</td> <td>Depends on type</td> <td>Parameter value.</td> </tr>
</table>

**Also unspecified fields can exist.**

The _web_ key contains parameters specifying high-level communication options:

<table>
    <th bgcolor="#999999">Name</th>
    <th bgcolor="#999999">Type</th>
    <th bgcolor="#999999">Description</th>
    <tr> <td>domain</td> <td>String</td> <td>Fully qualified domain name of application host. This domain name must be specified in header field Host of API requests.</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>ssl_enabled</td> <td>Bool</td> <td>Specifies if SSL/TLS encryption is enabled.</td> </tr>
</table>

The _authorization_ key contains authorization parameters. Authorization is required for un-safe request methods (PUT). The parameters are:

<table>
    <th bgcolor="#999999">Name</th>
    <th bgcolor="#999999">Type</th>
    <th bgcolor="#999999">Description</th>
    <tr> <td>password</td> <td>String</td> <td>Password.</td> </tr>
</table>

The value is empty string – it is write-only.

The key _"modules"_ belong to engine settings, _"system"_ – to communication settings.

### Set configuration [PUT]

#Request

The structure of data is the same as describe above, but certain parts may be absent.

Any of the first-level keys (modules, system) may be absent.

Some or all modules in _module-list_ may be absent. Each module must have the following minimal structure:

    module:
        {
            "name": {
                "parameters": [ parameter-list ]
            }
        }

For modules, some or all parameters in each parameter-list may be absent.

Each _parameter_ must have the following minimal structure:

    parameter:
        {
            "name": "name",
            "value": value,
        }

Any of the keys in _"system"_ (_web_, _authorization_) may be absent.

It is forbidden to change communication settings together with engine settings in one API call. 
The reason is that changing communication settings involves closing of network connection.

# Response

Certain engine settings require restart of engine and/or data service in order to apply them. 
If the component is running and have to restart, response has body with JSON

    { "restart": true }
    
Restart is performed automatically. Changing input device always requires restart of engine.

If restart is not needed, OK response has no body.

If communication settings are changes successfully, connection is closed and the client receives no response.

# Group State

This resource allows to get and set application state. The application state consists of engine state and data service state.

There are four states for **engine** and **data service**: _stopped_, _starting_, _running_, _stopping_.

If the **engine** is _starting_, _running_ or _stopping_, **data service** is doing the same (because it is part of engine). 
If **engine** is _stopped_, **data service** can be in any state.

    JSON data
    {
        "engine": "state",
        "data_service": "state"
    }
    
where _state_ is one of:

 - stopped
 - starting
 - running
 - stopping

## Current state [/state]

### Get current application state [GET]

+ Response 200 (application/json)
 + Body
 
            { 
                "data_service": "stopped", 
                "engine": "stopped" 
            }

### Set application state, i. e. start or stop engine and/or data service [PUT]

# Request

Starting and stopping engine can take several seconds, so the requests must have appropriate timeout.

Request JSON data structure is the same as described above, where **state** is _running_ to start and _stopped_ to stop 
**engine** or **data service**.
The combination of running engine and stopped data service is invalid.

# Response

If the application is already in requested state, response with status 200 OK is returned immediately.

If the engine or data service is in state transitional to requested, request is handled as if it was in state opposite 
to requested. For instance, if engine is starting and request with started is made, this request is handled as if 
engine was stopped, i.e. set to wait until operation is completed.

If the engine or data service is starting and stop is requested, or it is stopping and start is requested,

# Group Data

This resource allows to retrieve recognition data from current or previous sessions.

# Terminology
When an object is detected, the tracking system forms an internal image of it. This image persists for some time 
after object has disappeared from sight of input device. If the object appears in sight again until its image 
is deleted, it can be recognized as the same object and assigned the same identifier. It is said that object has 
**exited** and **reentered** to a scene. When tracking system has deleted object's image, the object is **lost**. 
Next time this object is detected it will be assigned other identifier.

## GET /data{?type,time,columns,parameters}

# Request

## Query parameters description

### type  
Specifies type of requested objects.  
There are two object types: _Face_ and _Body_. They are tracked separately. 
For tracking bodies a natural interaction input device is needed.
Only one object type can be specified in a request.
         
### time
Objects that was in sight during this time period will be returned.  
The possible values are:
<table>
    <th bgcolor="#999999">Value</th>
    <th bgcolor="#999999">Description</th>
    <tr> <td>now</td> <td>Return objects that was in sight in last frame of current session. Data service must be in active mode.</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>time-time</td> <td>Return objects that was in sight during this time period. See below for details.</td> </tr>
</table>

The _time_ values are specified as UTC in ISO 8601 extended format:

    YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS
    
### columns

Specifies list of object attributes to return.

The list format is comma-separated (without spaces).

Attributes are divided into **time attributes**, **social attributes**, **state
attributes** and **statistic attributes**.

Here is the brief description of attributes. Detailed description is in Response section.

Time attributes:

<table>
         <th>Name</th>         <th>Description</th>
    
    <tr> <td>enter_time</td>   <td>Time when object was (first) detected.</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>exit_time</td>    <td>Time when object was last seen.</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>time_periods</td> <td>Sequence of time periods during which object was in sight
                                   and exited in between.</td> </tr>
</table>

Time attributes can be queried only for time period, but not for the current frame.  


Social attributes (constant attributes of a person):

<table>
         <th>Name</th>              <th>Description</th>
    
    <tr> <td>gender</td>            <td>Person gender.</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>gender_confidence</td> <td>Confidence of gender value.</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>age</td>               <td>Person age.</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>age_confidence</td>    <td>Confidence of age value.</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>race</td>              <td>Person race.</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>race_confidence</td>   <td>Confidence of race value.</td> </tr>
</table>

Only Face objects have social attributes. These attributes can be queried for time period or current frame.


State attributes (instant person's state):

<table>
         <th>Name</th> <th>Now</th> <th>Time interval</th>
    
    <tr> <td>screen_position_x</td>  <td>Position - X coordinate.</td> <td>Sequence of object's X positions for given time interval.</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>screen_position_y</td>  <td>Position - Y coordinate.</td> <td>Sequence of object's Y positions for given time interval.</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>distance</td>           <td>Distance to camera.</td> <td>The closest distance to camera for given time interval.</td>  </tr>
    <tr> <td>emotion</td>            <td>Person emotion.</td> <td>Sequence of person's emotions for given time interval.</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>emotion_confidence</td> <td>Confidence of emotion value.</td> <td>Sequence of confidences for emotion values for given time interval.</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>look</td>               <td>If person looks at camera.</td> <td>Sequence of look indicators.</td> </tr>
    
</table>

Only Face objects have state attributes. These attributes can be queried for time period or current frame.


Statistic attributes:

<table>
         <th>Name</th>         <th>Description</th>
    
    <tr> <td>dwell_time</td>   <td>Time interval from first appearance to exit or current
                                   moment.</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>face_time</td>    <td>Sum of time intervals when person looked at the camera.</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>look_count</td> <td>Number of periods when person looked at the camera.</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>principal_emotion<sup>*</sup></td> <td>Prevalent person's emotion for all time or time interval.</td> </tr>
</table>

Body objects have `dwell_time` attribute only.

Statistic attributes can be queried for time period or current frame.

### parameters
List of statistic parameters to return.  
Statistic parameters are properties of sets of objects as opposed to individual objects.  
This query parameter is valid only for the Face objects and current session (time=now).  
The list format is comma-separated (without spaces).  
The statistic parameters are (detailed description is in Response section):

<table>
    <th>Name</th> <th>Description</th>
    <tr> <td>primary_gender</td>  <td>Gender of the Face object longest in view (for all view periods)
                                      during the current session.</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>majority_gender</td> <td>Current most prominent gender.</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>majority_emotion<sup>*</sup></td> <td>Current most prominent emotion.</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>main_person</td>     <td>Most prominent person.</td> </tr>
</table>

Here the DateTime type is String containing date and time written as UTC in ISO 8601 extended format:

    YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS

When data for time period is requested, returned values of social attributes correspond to time
moment `exit_time`.

## Results for time periods  

When request is made for a time period, the application determines which objects were in sight during this period and then returns the most complete information it has on that objects. The enter_time and exit_time parameters contain the very first (last) time an object was seen. So the enter_time might be before requested period and exit_time might be after it. The same applies to time_periods parameter - it contains all periods when person was in sight.  

For example, consider the following timeline:  

    person_time_1_1   - person was first detected  
    ...  
    person_time_1_2   - person temporarily disappeared  
    ...  
    query_time1 
    ...  
    person_time_2_1   - person re-entered  
    ...  
    query_time2  
    ...  
    person_time_2_2   - person was lost  

The requested time period is

    time=query_time1-query_time2
    
The result would be:

    "objects": [
      {
        "age": ...,   <- corresponds to person_time_2_2
        ... 
        "enter_time": person_time_1_1,
        "exit_time": person_time_2_2,
        ... 
        "time_periods": [
          {
            "enter_time": person_time_1_1,
            "exit_time": person_time_1_2
          },
          {
            "enter_time": person_time_2_1,
            "exit_time": person_time_2_2
          }

# Group Snapshots

This resource allows to save snapshot image of input video stream. Input video stream is the stream produced by 
input device. It does not display recognition marks.

## Current snapshots [/snapshots]

### Save snapshot of last input frame and return its URL [POST]

Image is saved in JPEG format. Its parameters and location are determined by settings of VisualSnapshotSaver module and can be configured via API.
If two or more requests are made for the same frame, snapshot is saved once.

# Response

Successful response has status 201 Created and header field Location specifying absolute URL of created snapshot.

    JSON data
    { "path": "path" }

where _"path"_ is the path part of URL of saved snapshot image.

The URL path is made by replacing base part of filesystem path, specified by setting 

    { 
        "modules" : { 
                "VisualSnapshotSaverHttpInterface" : { 
                    "path_find" : "path"
                }
        }
    } 

with path, specified by setting 

The URL path is made by replacing base part of filesystem path, specified by setting 

    { 
        "modules" : { 
                "VisualSnapshotSaverHttpInterface" : { 
                    "path_replace" : "path"
                }
        }
    }

It is the opposite to what Web server does with a path, so configurations of VisualSnapshotSaverHttpInterface 
and NGINX must be synchronized.

Snapshot file name has form

    date-time.jpg
    
where _date-time_ is UTC date and time of corresponding frame, represented according to ISO 8601, 
with 3-digit milliseconds:

    YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sss
    
## Example

Path remapping settings:

    { 
        "modules" : { 
                "VisualSnapshotSaverHttpInterface" : { 
                    "path_find" : /var/lib/look/snapshots,
                    "path_replace" : /snapshot_files
                }
        }
    }

NGINX configuration (relevant part):

    server { 
        location /snapshot_files { 
            alias /var/lib/look/snapshots; 
        }
    }
    
Then the snapshot

    /var/lib/look/snapshots/2012-06-20/2012-06-20T17:26:31.351.jpg
    
has URL

    http://kiosk-1:8181/snapshot_files/2012-06-20/2012-06-20T17:26:31.351.jpg

# Group Event notification

Client can define subscribers to various events, which receive notifications (HTTP requests) when events occur.

Subscriber is defined by URL and HTTP method.

    Subscriber:
        {
            "id" : id,
            
            "url" : "url",
            "method" : "method",
            
            "event_filters" : [ <EventFilter>-list ]
        }

where

<table>
    <th>Field</th>              <th>Type</th>    <th>Description</th>
    
    <tr> <td>id</td>            <td>Integer</td>
         <td>Subscriber ID.<br/>
             This field is read-only.</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>url</td>           <td>String</td>
         <td>URL which receives HTTP request on event.</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>method</td>        <td>String</td>
         <td>HTTP method used in request to subscriber on event.</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>event_filters</td> <td>Array</td>
         <td>Filters defining which events this subscriber receives.<br/>
             Conceptually this field specifies <b>subscriptions</b> of the subscriber.<br/>
             This field is also available via separate resource.</td> </tr>
</table>

Conceptually subscriber's subscription is information separate from subscriber itself, and has
its own resource. The `event_filters` field is merely a shortcut allowing to set subscriber and
its subscriptions in one request. As a consequence, `event_filters` field
- can be omitted when adding new subscriber;
- is not considered when comparing subscribers for equality.


## Conceptual structure of events

Note that this project is aimed to define universal event mechanism for LOOK and MOVE, and
also contains speculations about possible future events.

All events fall into three **types**:

1. object attribute changed - age, gender, distance etc;
2. statistic parameter changed - primary gender, main person etc;
3. object interacted with target - object moved into/out of scene or area, crossed line,
                                   person took an article into basket etc.

Applications can work with different types of objects. Particularly, LOOK handles faces and bodies
separately. Object types differ in possible attributes, statistic parameters and interactions.
So each event conceptually has field `object_type`.



### Object types

#### 1. Object attribute changed

Conceptually the structure of this event is

    {
        event_type: attribute_change
        object_type:
        object_id:
        
        attribute:
        value:
        previous_value:
        range:            # For continuous attributes
        previous_range:   # (see below)
    }


#### 2. Statistic parameter changed

    {
        event_type: statistic_parameter_change
        object_type:
        
        parameter:
        value:
        previous_value:
    }


#### 3. Object interacted with target

    {
        event_type: interaction
        object_type:
        object_id:
        
        target_type:   # scene, area, line, article etc
        target_id:
        interaction_type:
        interaction_direction:
    }


<div class="dev-comment">
<p>Often a value of one field implies specific value of other field(s). For example, object can
interact with an area in single way - moving in/out of it. So <code>event_type: interaction
</code> and <code>target_type: area</code> imply <code>interaction_type: move</code>.</p>

<p>Also we want to limit possibilities for client errors in requests, particularly concerning
specification of several values in some fields. For example, faces and bodies have different
attributes, so the filter</p>

<pre>
{
    event_type: attribute_change,
    object_type: [ face, body ],
    attribute: [ age, distance ]
}</pre>

<p>would be confusing because bodies do not have <code>age</code> attribute. We can eliminate the
potential confusion by removing <code>object_type</code> and combining it with <code>event_type</code>.
</p>

<p>These reasons lead us to concept of <b>event class</b>.</p>
</div>


For convenience, several conceptual fields combine into one actual field `event_class`.

## Event classes

### Object attribute change

#### Filter

    EventFilter:
        {
            "event_class": "face_attribute_change" | "body_attribute_change",
            "attribute": [ <attribute>-list ] | "*"
        }

Possible values of `<attribute>` are:<br/>
for faces - `age`, `gender`, `race`, `emotion`, `look`, `distance`;<br/>
for bodies - `distance`.<br/>
Description of attributes see in `/data` resource section.
The `"*"` means all attributes corresponding to object type specified by event class (face or body).


##### Examples

Filter for any face attribute change:

    {
        "event_class": "face_attribute_change",
        "attribute": "*"
    }
    
Filter for face gender or age change:

    {
        "event_class": "face_attribute_change",
        "attribute": ["gender", "age"]
    }


#### Notification

    {
        "event": {
            "timestamp": <timestamp>,

## Event subscribers collection [/notification_service/subscribers]

This resource represents the collection of all event subscribers, along with their subscriptions.


### Get subscribers and their subscriptions [GET]

#### Request body

No.


#### Response

##### Body

    [ <Subscriber>-list ]


+ Response 200 (application/json)

                    ]
                }
            ]



### Update collection of subscribers with their subscriptions [PUT]

Subscribers, having ID specified, are updated as if individual PUT was called for each of them.
Subscribers, having no ID specified, are added as if individual POST was called for each of them.
Existing subscribers, not specified (by ID) in request, are deleted as if individual DELETE was
called for each of them.

See individual PUT, POST, DELETE operations for additional notes.

Note. One of methods to preserve contents of a subscriber, is to specify only its ID and no
other fields.


#### Request body

    [ <Subscriber>-list ]


#### Response

##### Body

Array of IDs assigned to subscribers specified in request, in corresponding order.

##### Errors

### Add subscriber and, optionally, its subscriptions [POST]

#### Request body

    <Subscriber>

Field `id` must be absent. Field `event_filters` may be absent.

If field `event_filters` is present, it is processed after subscriber is created as if
`PUT /notification_service/subscribers/{id}/event_filters` was called.

#### Response

On success the response status is `201 Created` and `Location` header field contains URL of created
subscriber.

##### Body

    { "id": id }
where `id` is ID assigned to created subscriber.

##### Errors

# Group Continuous attributes

For purposes of event notification, object attributes with continuous values (like age, distance)
need to be divided into subranges. When value goes from one subrange to another, this is notified.

Continuous attributes are:

<table>
    <th>Object type</th> <th>Attributes</th>
    
    <tr class="code"> <td>face</td>   <td>age<br/>distance</td> </tr>
    <tr class="code"> <td>body</td>   <td>distance</td> </tr>
</table>

Subranges of an attribute are represented by `Subranges` object:

    Subranges:
        {
            "<name1>": [<a1>, <b1>],
            "<name2>": [<a2>, <b2>],
            ...
        }

where

<table>
    <th>Field</th>                  <th>Type</th>   <th>Description</th>
    
    <tr> <td class="code">name</td> <td>String</td> <td>Subrange name.</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td class="code">a, b</td> <td>Real</td>   <td>Subrange endpoints.</td> </tr>
</table>

Every subrange is right-open: [a, b), i.e. a &le; x &lt; b. Subranges must not intersect
and have gaps. If attribute value becomes greater then any specified subrange, it is considered
to be in virtual subrange named `undefined`.

`Subranges` object can be empty.
